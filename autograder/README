COMP 412, Fall 2023

The tar file in this directory contains a copy of the Lab 1 autograder and the 
Lab 1 Autotimer. The autograder includes a subset of the test files that will
be used to grade your actual submission. (You should test on as wide a range
of files as you can.)  The autotimer uses the full set of files that will be
used to time your actual submission.

To use this distribution, create a new directory and unpack the tar 
file into the directory.  (That is, copy the L1AG.tar into the directory 
and run the command:

   tar xvf L1AG.tar

This command should install a subtree that includes, among other files,

   auto_grade 
   auto_time
   Grader
   Timer
   TarFileGoesHere

Next, you need to configure both the autograder and the autotimer so
that they know where they are in the file system.

1.   Edit the file auto_grade/auto_grade.py.

     You will need to change "base_name" so that it points to the 
     directory that contains the file "Grader". Note that "base_name" 
     must end with a slash.

     You may need to change the "normal_deadline" date.

2.   Edit the file auto_time/auto_time.py and change the definition of 
     "base_name" so that it points to the directory that contains the 
     "Grader" file.  Note that "base_name" must end with a slash.

The directory DefaultTarFiles includes tar files for testing: comp412.tar
and noway.tar. comp412.tar is a working submission.  noway.tar is a
nonworking submission. You can use these to verify that your
autograder / autotimer installation works. To test the installation,
move one or both of these files into TarFileGoesHere/ and run the command:

   ./Grader

That should create a log file in the current directory. The log file's
name will start with "Grader-" and end with ".log". In the log file, 
you should see that noway failed to work and comp412 worked correctly
(no unexpected errors on the correct blocks and scores of 0 on the
erroneous inputs).

Now, delete the log file. If you want to delete the two test tar 
files, remove them from the directory "TarFileGoesHere". Copy your 
tar file into "TarFileGoesHere" and run the autograder again. The
log file should give you a reasonable picture of what happened.  
(Be certain that you are looking at the most recent log file. I 
always delete the log file before running the autograder.)

To run the timer, use the command:

   ./Timer

It may take a while. It uses eight input files and runs the submission
on each file five times. It keeps the minimum time for each file (to 
lessen the effects of interference from other programs running on the
system.)

The autotimer creates a log file that begins with "Timer-". It contains
details on the autotimer's run. Note that the autotimer will kill any
run that exceeds sixty seconds. No submission should need that much time.

The files in the results directory are suitable for importing into Excel
as tab-separated text files.
